Neural network and Deep learning: What number is this?

Part 1:
convert a 28x28 pixel image into an array of value for every pixel
	Array size = 28x28
	Each number stored is the intensity of each pixel. Number from 0-1;
	Challenge: how to gather pixel values into array

Part 2:
Create the neural network
	- 784 (28 x 28) input nodes
	- s sets of sigmouid neurons
	- n number of neurons per set
	- 10 number of output neurons for numbers 0-9
	- weights stored in a matrix

Part 3:
Backpropagation
